# sudoku_from_image
This is a small fun project build using pygame, opencv and tensorflow that can read sudoku image file and let you solve it. There is also an option such that it will solve the board
from where you left it.
## To run the program

Open a command prompt and type 
> python gui.py
## Note:
If the ML model make any mistakes in the prediction or you have made any wrong changes, the program won't warn you and the solve functionality would do nothing.
